## Convolutional Neural Networks and Image Classification

This tutorial demonstrates training a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images. It creates an image classifier using a Keras Tensorflow Framework. You also will gain practical experience with the concepts of efficiently loading a dataset from disk and identifying overfitting and applying techniques to mitigate it, including data augmentation and Dropout

## Transfer learning and fine-tuning
In this tutorial, you will learn how to use transfer learning and create new powerful model from a pre-trained neural network to take advantage of previously learned feature maps without having to start from scratch.
